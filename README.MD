This repository is for a procedural heightmap generator. I currently have the 'mapGen' program configured to generates lakes. It makes a heightmap using different layers of perlin noise (and optionally, manually made PNG files) and then converts each pixel to a color according to the range it falls in. The 'Lunkers' file blits the map.png to screen with the boat as well as a "minimap." This is just a quick mock-up UI for an idea I had for a fishing game/simulator.
